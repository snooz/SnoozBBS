# SnoozBBS

I made this one as a hobby project once upon a time. This project is something I use to learn more about Python
I have now added SSH support for SnoozBBS and removed the old Telnet support.
Create a key using ssh-keygen and place the keys in the config folder or anywhere else you want and update the path in the bbs.json file

## Backstory

Back in the 1990's I used to run a PCBoard BBS, PCBoard was created by The Clark Development Company and was a BBS system that ran on top of MS-DOS or OS/2, I personally used it in MS-DOS. I still have the manual to this day, a book of about 800 pages. One day I felt nostalgic and wanted to recreate this experience somewhat and setup a telnet server in python and then moved on to handling the colors as well as some of the menu commands. I had intended to have it be able to load PPE (Extensions for PCBoard) or at least from the source files. But I havent done anything on this project in the past 5 years or so, so I leave it here in case someone wants to fork it and continue on it, feel free to do so.
